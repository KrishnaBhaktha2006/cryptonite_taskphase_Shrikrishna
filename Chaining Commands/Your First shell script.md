# Your First shell script
## Code:
```bash
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ touch x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ echo "/challenge/pwn" >> x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ echo "/challenge/college" >> x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ bash x.sh
Great job, you've written your first shell script! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{oU9IkPVvX6NpocOm03heYSlMvxg.dFzN4QDL0kTN0czW}
```
